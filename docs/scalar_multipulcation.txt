Multiply a point P by a scalar k to get another point Q on the curve 

Q = k * P

Can use the Double-and-Add Algorithm...
    - Essentially adding P k-times.

    -Steps 
        - Start with Q = 0

        For each bit in k...
        - Even if the leading bit is not 1, P = 2P
        - If leading bit is 1, then Q = Q + P
