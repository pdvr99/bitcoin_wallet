Let's say we have two points...

P = (x1, y1) & Q = (x2, y2)

p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 977 --> This is the large prime number used in secp256k1 algorithm...

lamda = (y2 - y1)/(x2 -x1) (mod p)

x3 = (lamda)^2 - x1 - x2 (mod p)

y3 = lamda * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p)

The x and y components of the points are 256 bits each respectively...
