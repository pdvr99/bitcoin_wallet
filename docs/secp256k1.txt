Step 1: 
    - Start with P (x1, y1)
    - Initlaize a point at inifinity (Let's call this R) --> This will be th eresults

Step 2: 
    - Go through all bits in k...
        - Double P --> P = 2P 
        - Add if current bit in k is 1 --> R = R + P 

Step 3: 
    - Get the resulting point, which si the public key.
